# VideoToMP3-MicroServices
Video to MP3 Converter
I wanted some experience with micro services so I made this video to MP3 converter hosted on a local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube).

Technologies I used include Docker, Kubernetes, Flask, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, MySQL, k9s, etc.

There is a service for authorization, a service for gateway (what the user interacts with), a service for the actual video to MP3 conversion, a queue service, and a notification service.
